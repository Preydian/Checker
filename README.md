# Destiny 2 Queue Checker

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a web application that leverages the Bungie API to track and notify users when their current Destiny 2 activity changes. 
The primary purpose of this tool is to assist players in finding multiplayer activities with long queue times

## Problem

Currently, players must keep their monitor/tv in view, or they must periodically check to see if they have a game.
If a player chooses to do other work while waiting for a game then they will have to guess when they might have a game. 
Resulting in the player either checking too frequently and thus disrupting their other activity. 
Or checking too infrequently, resulting in the player being AFK for part of the game or until they are kicked for inactivity (can get banned for this)

## Solution

- **Real-time Activity Tracking:** The application continuously monitors the user's current activity in Destiny 2.
- **Notification System:** Users receive timely notifications whenever their activity changes, helping them stay informed and engaged.
- **Bungie API Integration:** Utilizes the Bungie API to access Destiny 2 player data, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

Destiny 2 Queue Checker fixes the above problem through the use of notifications. The player will receive a notification once an activity has been found, giving the player ample time to finish what they were doing and return to their game.
This allows players to focus on other tasks while waiting for a game. Whether it be eating, watching YouTube, doing the dishes, lying down, or doing school/uni work etc.
